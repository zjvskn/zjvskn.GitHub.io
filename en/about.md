## About Me

- I'm an engineer based in Hangzhou, China, specializing in front-end development, with some experience in Swift, Rust, Python, and a bit of design.
- I'm a fan of open-source culture and not keen on the tech influencer scene. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and am a strong believer in long-termism.
- I have a passion for creating products that are simple, beautiful, and user-friendly. I've developed projects such as [**MiaoYan**](https://github.com/tw93/MiaoYan), [**Pake**](https://github.com/tw93/pake), [**Maple**](https://github.com/tw93/Maple), [**XRender**](https://xrender.fun/), and [**WeexUi**](https://apache.github.io/incubator-weex-ui/).
- My blog [**Tw93**](https://tw93.fun/), is where I share my insights on technology, life, and thought processes. Through [**Trend Weekly**](https://weekly.tw93.fun/), I share cool finds every week.
