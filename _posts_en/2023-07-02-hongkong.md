## The Beginning

A few months ago, thanks to an introduction by Uncle Wolf, GIAC's Global Internet Architecture Conference invited me to share about the integration of Rust and frontend technologies. The conference was in Shenzhen, and I immediately accepted the offer. Despite having traveled extensively, I had never visited Shenzhen or Hong Kong. Some good friends live there, and finally, there was a "pretext" to visit, which felt great.

However, my flight from Hangzhou to Shenzhen on Friday night was delayed from 7:40 PM to 10:40 PM. Arriving in Shenzhen around 1 AM, it took me over 20 minutes just to walk out of the airport. After a taxi ride to the hotel, it was already 2:30 AM, and I was exhausted.

I was scheduled to speak in the afternoon session of the second day. Attending the morning sessions, I noticed how hot AIGC was, while Web 3.0 and Node seemed a bit on the decline. After the day ended, my friends took me out for a barbecue. Although I didn't explore much of Shenzhen, the oysters were truly exceptional (YYDS). Later, we strolled around Shenzhen Bay, gazing at Hong Kong across the water, and then headed to a bar for some casual drinks, which was quite enjoyable.

The next morning, I headed to Hong Kong. I took a taxi to Futian station, and a 15-minute high-speed train ride later, I arrived at Hong Kong's West Kowloon station. It felt just like taking the subway, albeit with an additional immigration process.

## Observations

It was my first visit to Hong Kong. I'm not the type to rush through tourist attractions; instead, I prefer to observe the cultural and environmental settings. I noticed several aspects that were "**Not What I Expected**," which I'll casually talk about here.

1. On Sundays, parks, plazas, and bridges are filled with gatherings of Filipino maids. I was surprised by their numbers. Despite the rain, they sat on the ground with large and small bags around them, clad in colorful attire, eating, chatting, laughing, singing, and even video chatting with family. It felt like a joyful day off for these hardworking individuals. I saw many such gatherings at Victoria Harbour and later at Kowloon Park. After some research, I learned that Sundays are their official day off. Since restaurants and malls can be expensive, public spaces become a popular choice for these gatherings, reminiscent of a low-key version of camping activities in our country. This also highlights Hong Kong's inclusivity.

2. The cost of living in Hong Kong is higher than I expected. A bottle of water costs 10 HKD, and a small sandwich from FamilyMart is 30 HKD. Dining at a slightly upscale restaurant can set you back by an average of 500 HKD per person, which deterred me. However, prices at Starbucks are similar to those in mainland China. The fees for services surprised me too; storing luggage at West Kowloon station cost me 140 HKD, and forgetting a locker's code meant paying an additional 60 HKD. Uber rides are pricey; a short trip can easily cost 60 HKD, reminiscent of taxi fares in Japan. Thankfully, the extensive subway network makes public transportation a viable option. Yet, there are places where prices are only marginally higher than in mainland China. For example, dining at "WaSo Ice Room" in Tsim Sha Tsui, we ordered five dishes for just under 160 HKD, leaving us full and satisfied.

3. Public spaces are exceptionally accessible, creating an atmosphere of equality. Almost every traffic light, elevator, and subway station is equipped to assist visually impaired individuals. Traffic lights emit beeping sounds to indicate when it's safe to cross, and handrails and subway barriers have prominent Braille labels. Even subway station entrances feature Braille for reading and button interactions.

4. Transportation in Hong Kong has its peculiarities, starting with customizable license plates. In mainland China, plates like "666" or "ILoveYou" would seem fake, but they're perfectly legal in Hong Kong. Cars drive incredibly fast, giving small vehicles a racing feel. Interestingly, adherence to traffic lights isn't strict; about a third of pedestrians cross on red lights if the road is clear.

5. People in Hong Kong are generally friendly. A local gentleman at the high-speed train station went out of his way to give us directions. Convenience store staff are courteous in explaining things, and it's common to see older individuals working. The streets are filled with foreigners and locals alike, engaging in conversations in Cantonese, which thrilled me as a fan of Hong Kong movies and Cantonese music.

6. Other observations include the scarcity of power banks (bring your own next time), extremely cold air conditioning in malls, and unpredictable rain showers (an umbrella is a must).

Observing the cultural and environmental aspects of Hong Kong on my first visit, I discovered many aspects that were **"Not What I Expected"** and wish to share them here.

1. **Sunday Gatherings of Filipino Maids:** Surprisingly, parks, plazas, and bridges were crowded with Filipino maids on Sundays. Despite the rain, they sat on the ground, surrounded by their belongings, wearing colorful clothes, eating, chatting, laughing, singing, and video chatting with family. This joyful day off seemed like a happy, hardworking holiday. I witnessed this vibrant scene in Victoria Harbour and Kowloon Park. Sundays are their official rest days, and due to high expenses in restaurants and malls, public places become a preferred spot for gatherings with homemade food, reminiscent of a low-key version of camping activities in our country. This showcases Hong Kong's inclusivity.

2. **High Cost of Living:** The cost of living in Hong Kong was higher than expected. A bottle of water costs 10 HKD, and a small sandwich from FamilyMart is 30 HKD. Dining at a decent restaurant can easily reach an average of 500 HKD per person, which deterred me, although Starbucks prices are similar to those in mainland China. Service fees surprised me; luggage storage at West Kowloon station cost 140 HKD, and forgetting a locker's code required an extra 60 HKD. Considering Uber for a short 1.5 km trip showed a fare of 60 HKD, reminiscent of taxi fares in Japan. Fortunately, the extensive subway network facilitates public transportation. Yet, some places seemed only slightly more expensive than in mainland China. For instance, dining at "WaSo Ice Room" in Tsim Sha Tsui, we spent under 160 HKD for five dishes, feeling full and satisfied.

3. **Accessibility in Public Spaces:** Public spaces in Hong Kong are remarkably accessible, promoting an atmosphere of equality. Traffic lights, elevators, and subways are well-equipped for visually impaired users, with audible signals at traffic lights and Braille on elevator handrails and subway barriers, even allowing for Braille reading and button interaction at subway station entrances.

4. **Unique Transportation Aspects:** Vehicle license plates in Hong Kong can be customized, which is quite fascinating. The driving side is the same as in the UK, with cars driving incredibly fast, and small cars giving off a racing vibe. Interestingly, adherence to traffic lights isn't strict; about a third of pedestrians cross even during red lights if the road is clear.

5. **Friendly Encounters:** Many people, including a helpful gentleman at the high-speed train station and a courteous convenience store worker, were exceptionally friendly. The streets had a fair number of elderly workers, indicating a society that offers employment opportunities to older individuals. The presence of many foreigners and locals alike, conversing in Cantonese, excited me as a fan of Hong Kong movies and Cantonese music.

6. **Other Observations:** The scarcity of power banks suggests bringing your own on the next visit. Also, mall air conditioning is exceptionally cold, and the weather tends to be unpredictable with sudden rain showers, making an umbrella necessary. Additionally, large screens outside malls displaying news and stock market indices, along with the ease of communication in fluent Cantonese or English, enhance the experience. For instance, ordering a Flat White at Starbucks revealed the importance of understanding local terms.

In conclusion, while the cost of living is higher than expected, the culture, atmosphere, and scenic beauty of Hong Kong make it worth a second visit.
